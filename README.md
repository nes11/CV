With a diverse background that goes well beyond tech skills, I am looking to join a team that fosters a challenging but supportive environment. I have trained as a full-stack JavaScript developer, building APIs in Express and front-ends in React. I learned how to deliver value in a timely fashion whilst also striving to craft elegant, well-designed code. 

I have strong interpersonal skills acquired through a long career as a teacher and a degree in communications. I have also briefly trained as an Agile Coach. I am involved in the JavaScript community (e.g. London Node User Group), and I benefit from the mentorship of a senior developer. 

I am looking for a junior position with a company that values the soft skills I bring to the table and will nurture my career as a developer. Have a look at my GitHub! https://github.com/nes11

## **Experience**  
**In Education**: teacher, tutor, governess  
Most of my professional experience from January 2011 to July 2018 is in education. I am a UK-trained teacher of Modern Foreign Language and I have applied my skills and knowledge in many different settings (private and state schools, as well as private households) with students within a wide age-range (primary and secondary, and adults). 

**Executive receptionist** - Engie, La Défense, Paris, France (Jan. 2013-Feb. 2014)  
I coordinated hospitality for the executive floors at Engie (#104 on the 2018 Fortune Global 500 list) with a focus on high-profile international visitors and the board of directors. I managed junior staff (PAs and other executive assistants) and the work of contractors, effectively a gatekeeper to the company’s executives.

## **Education**  
**Post Graduate Certificate in Education (September 2009-June 2010)**  
Secondary/Modern Foreign Languages – French specialist  
_Cardiff Metropolitan University (formerly UWIC) – Cardiff, Wales_  
The course included two 4-month school placements. I was first awarded a 2 (Good), then a 1 (Outstanding) after formal classroom-based assessments. I focussed on child protection, behaviour management, effective lesson planning and assessment. I conducted empirical studies into formative assessment and motivation for learning languages.  

**BA in Communication Studies (September 2002-June 2006)**  
_SATCOM Université Paris VIII – St Denis, France_  
Multidisciplinary (i.e. semiotics, sociology, economy) study of Information, Communication and Media, including theory, case studies and practical applications. 

## **Personal information**
Languages: French (native speaker), English (fluent), Spanish (beginner).  
Right to work in the United Kingdom as EU citizen.

I have written, directed and edited short films ranging from documentary to satire and comedy.  
I love cooking, especially baking. My specialties include chocolate lave cakes, banana bread, pear frangipane tart and more!  
I enjoy making/customizing my clothing and have recently started doing embroidery.  
I am training to run a 10k, I am strong swimmer and play badminton and table tennis.  
I have always been an avid reader (classics, sci-fi/postmodernist novels, essays, and biographies).
