I have now been a JavaScript developer for 2 years, after leaving the teaching world behind (and I have not looked back!). A successful first role as a professional programmer had me working on a complex codebase with talented and experienced colleagues. I am now looking to take the next step in my career, with a company that values the technical and soft skills I bring to the table and will nurture my career as a developer.

I have strong interpersonal skills acquired through a long career as a teacher and a degree in communications. I am involved in the JavaScript community (e.g. London Node User Group), and I benefit from the mentorship of senior developers.

I have experience building and maintaining front-end (React.js) and back-end (Node.js) JavaScript codebases; I have worked with containerised environments (Docker) and a variety of databases (mostly PostgreSQL and MonogoDB). I am passionate about simple clean code, functional programming, CI/CD, and Agile (having briefly trained as an Agile Coach).

## **Experience**  
**May 2019 - present: full-stack JavaScript developer – VoxSmart**  
Voxsmart offers brokers and traders a unified comms surveillance platform, for regulatory compliance. We manage a microservices platform hosted on AWS ECS, with services written in JavaScript, Java & Python. As part of the 3-person JavaScript team, I am responsible for maintaining the integrity and accessibility of our data, and developing features for the main voice-recording server (integrating with Twilio). My current focus is on developing a backend server to support mobile IM capture. We follow design principles enforced by our team lead: clean code and refactoring, building things incrementally, and continuous integration.

**January 2011 - July 2018: in Education: teacher, tutor, governess**  
I am a UK-trained teacher of Modern Foreign Language and I have applied my skills and knowledge in many different settings (private and state schools, as well as private households) with students within a wide age-range (primary and secondary, and adults).

I coordinated hospitality for the executive floors at Engie (#104 on the 2018 Fortune Global 500 list) with a focus on high-profile international visitors and the board of directors. I managed junior staff (PAs and other executive assistants) and the work of contractors, effectively a gatekeeper to the company’s executives.
