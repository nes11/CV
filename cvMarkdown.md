With a diverse background that goes well beyond tech skills, I am looking to join a team that fosters a challenging and supportive environment. I have trained as a full-stack JavaScript developer, building APIs in Express.js and frontends in React. I have focused on learning how to deliver value in a timely fashion whilst also striving to craft elegant, well-designed code.  
Unlike many developers, I have strong interpersonal skills and excellent work ethic that I acquired through a long career as a teacher and a degree in communications. I have also briefly trained as an Agile Coach. I am involved in the JavaScript community, attending meet ups such as the London Node User Group, and I benefit from the mentorship of a senior developer.  
While I loved teaching a class of children, a career as a developer appeals to me because of the strong emphasis on self-development. I really enjoy learning new skills and new ways of thinking, and forming opinions on the latest programming paradigms: I favour FP over OOP, immutability over mutation, and value SOLID code design where applicable. 
I am looking for a junior position with a company that values the soft skills I bring to the table and will nurture my career as a developer.

## **Projects**  
---

As I learn best by doing, I have built web apps from scratch to support my exploration of the MERN stack: 
 
|  Description | Tech used  |
|---|---|
|**Webscraping**: using Axios, Cheerio, MongoDB and Nodemailer, I am currently developing an app that fetches links to job adverts matching defined criteria, and stores them alongside relevant data in a database. When a new document is added, an email is sent to the address provided in the form of an HTML table.  |  Axios Cheerio MongoDB Nodemailer Node.js VSCode |
|**Timesheet**: this is my first app that puts the whole MERN stack to work. After writing tests for the app’s functionality, I built it up incrementally, starting with a MVP. On the way, I became better acquainted with Express.js, discovered the joys of Promises with Async/await, used CRUD ops after creating a database with MongoDB (that I ran in a Docker container), and had fun with React.js and Material-UI.  | MERNstack Chai/Axios Async/await Docker Material-UI Node.js VSCode  |
|**ToDo list**: I first wrote tests (Mocha and Axios) then coded two implementations that passed the tests (as a function and as a class). This app includes HTML eventListeners for a simple dynamic UI. I used Browserify to bundle the app for use in the browser.   | Mocha/Axios Browserify HTML Node.js VSCode  |
|**Rock, paper, scissors**: I started with two simple functions written as part of an online training course, and built it up incrementally using Express.js and basic HTML: first as simple function (with hard-coded playerChoice) then with Express.js interpreting query string and finally using HTML buttons.   | Express.js HTML Node.js Atom  |

## **Experience**

**In Education**: teacher, tutor, governess  
Most of my professional experience from January 2011 to July 2018 is in education. I am a UK-trained teacher of Modern Foreign Language and I have applied my skills and knowledge in many different settings (private and state schools, as well as private households) with students within a wide age-range (primary and secondary, and adults). 

**Executive receptionist** - Engie, La Défense, Paris, France (Jan. 2013-Feb. 2014)  
I coordinated hospitality for the executive floors at Engie (#104 on the 2018 Fortune Global 500 list) with a focus on high-profile international visitors and the board of directors. I managed junior staff (PAs and other executive assistants) and the work of contractors, effectively a gatekeeper to the company’s executives.

## **Education**

**Post Graduate Certificate in Education (September 2009-June 2010)**  
Secondary/Modern Foreign Languages – French specialist  
_Cardiff Metropolitan University (formerly UWIC) – Cardiff, Wales_  
The course included two 4-month school placements. I was first awarded a 2 (Good), then a 1 (Outstanding) after formal classroom-based assessments. I focussed on child protection, behaviour management, effective lesson planning and assessment. I conducted empirical studies into formative assessment and motivation for learning languages.  

**BA in Communication Studies (September 2002-June 2006)**  
_SATCOM Université Paris VIII – St Denis, France_  
Multidisciplinary (i.e. semiotics, sociology, economy) study of Information, Communication and Media, including theory, case studies and practical applications.
